    <p>There are around 7500 tomato varieties grown for various purposes.</p>

    <p> Heirloom tomatoes are becoming increasingly popular, particularly among home gardeners and organic producers,</p>
    <p>  since they tend to produce more interesting and flavorful crops at the cost of disease resistance and productivity.</p>
    <p>  In 1973, Israeli scientists developed the world's first long shelf-life commercial tomato varieties.</p>

    <p2>Tomatoes are now eaten freely throughout the world.
        They contain the carotene ​lycopene​, one of the most powerful natural ​antioxidants​.
        In some studies, lycopene, especially in cooked tomatoes, has been found to help prevent ​prostate cancer​,​[36]​
        but other research contradicts this claim.​[37] Lycopene has also been shown to improve the skin's ability to protect against harmful UV rays.​[38]​
        A study done by researchers at Manchester and Newcastle universities revealed that tomato can protect against sunburn and help keeping the skin looking youthful.​[39]​
        Natural genetic variation in tomatoes and their wild relatives has given a genetic plethora of genes that produce lycopene, carotene, anthocyanin, and other antioxidants.
        Tomato varieties are available with double the normal ​vitamin C​ (Doublerich), 40 times normal ​vitamin A​(97L97), high levels of ​anthocyanin​ (resulting in ​blue tomatoes​),
        and two to four times the normal amount of lycopene (numerous available cultivars with the high crimson gene).</p2>

<div id="Health Benefits" class="tabcontent">
    <h4>Health Benefits</h4>
    <br>
    <p2>Lycopene​ has also been shown to protect against oxidative damage in many epidemiological and experimental studies.
        In addition to its antioxidant activity, other metabolic effects of lycopene have also been demonstrated.
        The richest source of lycopene in the diet is tomato and tomato derived products.​
        [40]​ Tomato consumption has been associated with decreased risk of breast cancer,​[41]​ head and neck cancers[​ 42]​
        and might be strongly protective against neurodegenerative diseases.
        [​ 43][​ 44][​ 45]​ Tomatoes, tomato sauces and puree are said to help ​lower urinary tract symptoms​ (​BPH)​ and may have anticancer properties.​[46]​
        Tomato consumption might be beneficial for reducing cardiovascular risk associated with type 2 diabetes.[​ 47]</p2>
</div>

<div id="Storage" class="tabcontent">
    <h4>Storage</h4>
    <br>
    <p2>Tomatoes keep best unwashed at room temperature and out of direct sunlight. It is not recommended to refrigerate as this can harm the flavor.​
        [48]​ Tomatoes that are not yet ripe can be kept in a paper bag till ripening.​
        [49]​ Storing stem down can prolong shelf life.​[50]</p2>
